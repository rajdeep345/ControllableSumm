He spent a great deal of time ( whilst driving ) on one of his many mobile phones , at one point abandoned us at a Dead Sea resort for the better part of a half-day ( an hour would have been more than enough for the obligatory swim ) so that he could spend some time with his family who lived near by , and raced us back to Amman ( ignoring our provided itinerary ) in effect wasting a full day we could have spent visiting for example , the Crusader Castles that were only a short detour from the main highway .",January,2016,January,2016,John T,Australia,Oceania,male,1,1,male,8
